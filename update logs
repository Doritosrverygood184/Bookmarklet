Realease Update 0.0.0

Hello, and welcome to the blooket menu where you can find blooket bot, chatgpt, and edpuzzle hacks.  
Please keep in mind though, this is the release stage of this bookmarklet menu and there could be some bugs.
If you have any ideas of what I could add or improve, please type them down in the suggestions section.
Anyways, here's what you should know:

-Edpuzzle auto answer isnt working due to it being patched (skip video and 2x video speed are still avaiable)
-Minimization for blooket bot and chatgpt do close the iframes completely

That's pretty much all for now, thanks for taking the time to read this update log!
